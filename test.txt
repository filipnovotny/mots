Living post-communism: differences and similarities of two lives

My name is Janyl, I am 25 years old, I live in a small village in Central Asia.
My name is Filip, I am 27, from Prague, Czech Republic.
An unlikely couple, we are both children of the post-communist transition; yet our lives could not have been more different after the Eastern bloc collapsed.

I, Janyl do not remember the soviet times but I grew up hearing all about them. My parents are simple farmers as were their parents before them. Farming in eastern Kyrgyzstan usually bears fruit but it can’t be insured against unlucky weather or general downsides of life. In the West, people prevent starvation by saving money for difficult times but unfortunately, managing money was never part of Kyrgyz culture, traditionally nomadic herders and hunters. It was therefore a huge relief for everyone I know that the state provided for each of us enough to survive in exchange for honest work and that is all we asked for.
There were downsides of course, people could not practice their religion, usually going to mosques in secret but overall, soviet times are remembered as happy times.

In the end of 1991, as I was two years old, the Soviet Union fell and with it our economic stability. Suddenly, there was no work and there was no solution as how to feed ourselves during winter. That is why my father and friends of his designed a plan to sell fruits and vegetables from the whole village to neighbouring Kazakhstan. It was a bold and smart business idea given the times and context. Crops in this part of Kyrgyzstan are excellent and renowned all over Central Asia for their quality. Our people still had free passage to most of the former soviet states despite the soviet union not being there anymore so my father just had to drive a few thousand kilometers to Astana, the rich emerging Kazakh capital to sell.
Unfortunately, the independence of the former USSR states triggered a soaring chaos and lawlessness almost everywhere and the never-ending steppes of Kazakhstan were just impossible to control.
Gangsters, organised or not were raiding the desert routes, trapping vehicles in the sand, robbing, killing, kidnapping, torturing even.
It was only a matter of time before such thing happened to my father.

In 1993, a group of armed robbers stopped his truck going back with the money from Astana to our village. The driver was kicked out and my father taken away to a place to be murdered. Luckily, after much deliberation they decided to spare his life for my mother has just given birth to my little brother and even the bandits felt it was wrong to kill the father of a newborn.
My father returned home with nothing and faced the wrath of a crowd of villagers who were just left with no crops and no money either.

Since communism had ended and with it any remote hope of state welfare, my father sunk deep into debt. He borrowed money from banks to give back to the villagers. Then he borrowed money from other banks to pay up the first bank and then even more money from questionable people. Ironically, ended up borrowing money from the very kind of people who robbed him.

When my older brothers and sisters grew up, they could find work and step by step, we paid up more and more of the debt. But as our situation was getting just a little brighter, it was getting much darker for my country. Our president, Askar Akayev mistook Kyrgyzstan for his personal bank account and my country was getting poorer and poorer for his own profit.
In 2005, a revolution begun. It was a sad time and people were killed. In Kyrgyzstan, we do not have a rational relationship to our land, we have an emotional one. We do not interest ourselves in politics but we love our land with our heart. That is why my people could not let this man destroy our land and freedom for selfish reasons.
He fled to Kazakhstan and then Russia taking much of the country’s capital with him.

With the country getting poorer and the government using money for themselves, we were slowly sliding from attempted democracy to anarchy. A terrible tradition, bridenapping, suppressed during the soviet union was resurfacing. It consists of kidnapping a woman and forcing her to marry the kidnapper. While many visitors in Kyrgyzstan calm their conscience by thinking that it is a game and the victim is secretly consensual, that is not always true. In fact, it is often not true.
In a matter of years, marriage by kidnapping has switched from being rare in 1990 to more than half of marriages being done by kidnapping in 2009.

I was abducted and kidnapped when I was 19 years old in broad daylight in the center of Bishkek, the capital city, as I was going to the train station. I didn’t even know the guy, I saw him once, or, to be more precise, he saw me.
He drove me to the other side of the country, to the city of Naryn where he and his family pushed me to marry him. I threatened suicide to be allowed a monitored phone call to my sister. Everything I could say was scripted beforehand but I saved myself by saying a sentence in english between the lines. Very few people speak english here, only Kyrgyz and Russian, courtesy of the soviet union. A friend working in the police rescued me but I did not press charges. I saw enough hardship in my life to be hungry for revenge.

I returned to the capital to continue my studies, as calm and happy as can be but things did not stay calm for long. In 2010 it had become obvious that our new president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev has also mistaken Kyrgyzstan for his wallet and was now siphoning money quicker than ever while planning his escape. There was a second revolution and this time, I was there. I was leading a group of women to safety from the shooting in the streets and I was scared as never before. I hid them in the underground of an empty room of an abandoned factory and told them to keep quiet. I then ran into the other room and once I was safe and nobody could see me, I let all my fear out and I cried. I cried because I was afraid and because my brothers and sisters were dying and because I hate war. I just hoped god would save us all.
Mr. Bakiyev did as everyone before him, he fled Kyrgyzstan with as much of our money as he could carry to Belarus and has been living there ever since.

Needless to say that with all that Chaos, people tend to miss the soviet union. It actually seems like everyone misses it everywhere I go; thus, I was surprised when I met a traveller from Czech Republic, who told a different story. I met and helped him while he was hitchhiking across Eurasia, waiting in Kyrgyzstan for his Chinese visa. Together, we did a crowdfunding campaign which helped me resolve much of my parents debt. We fell in love, against all odds, traditions, religions and common sense. I wanted to see Paris.

I, Filip was born in Prague, in summer 1987, under one of the many communist puppet regimes in eastern and central Europe. My grandfather was accused of being a counter-revolutionary on some fabricated evidence and sent to a camp where he had to do forced labour in a coal mine. It was hard work in poor conditions and he ended up dying of the consequences a few years after I was born.
My mother was denied all opportunity to study because her father told voiced an opinion against the regime and such acts had dire consequences at the time. But my parents were not ones to give up.
My mother eventually found a school who would take her following an apology for what my grandfather said. She could not choose her subject but at least she could get a college education. She ended up studying cybernetics and artificial intelligence, a subject completely useless at the time.
During communist times, freedom was as realistic as your average Coca-Cola ad. Laws didn’t make any sense, food was repetitive, featureless and sometimes scarce and store shelves were often empty. My family had just one wish, to get out of here.
A family friend was often saying: “If I could lay hands on these tiny planes, I wouldn’t mind flying over the border, even if I had to jump between the bullets with a parachute.”
Fortunately, no one I know really followed him on that idea.

As communism was coming to an end and the iron curtain opened, we left Czech Republic for the west. My father, being a university professor had invitations from a French institute so we went to live there. But as the western powers rejoiced over the fall of the Eastern block and the beginning of a new era of peace and mutual understanding, we didn’t perceive it that way. For the average southern french, we were part of the USSR, that is, in common terms, a bunch of gangsters and prostitutes.
My mother was faced never-ending ludacris suspicion from various branches of french bureaucracy wondering whether she was my father’s legitimate wife and not someone who has come to france to launch a prostitution ring. 
It was never official nor was there any direct accusations; it was constant questions and remarks from officials which made my mother feel weird to say the least.
But my father was rising quickly in the academic circle securing key positions, writing scientific books and my mother’s residence permit was renewed everytime.
There was a gap growing, between the feeling of unity, openness and acceptance advertised by the powers that be and my family’s integration into the western society.

It was like the Berlin Wall had blown up and we better watch out for concrete blocks falling down on us. Or to be precise, on my mother and father who had obvious eastern accents whereas me and my brother learned perfect French and could be seen as locals. Of course there was minor differences, I didn’t grow up with disney and didn’t have the same cultural references, I had a different experience of communism than my fellow classmates and later demonstrating revolutionary left-wing wannabees but overall, I was just like any other weird kid in high school.

By 2004 Czech Republic became a member of the European Union and a year later, I got my french nationality after 12 years of “accelerated procedure”. My brother and father also got it but not my mother. They told us that here in France, we could have running water everywhere, unlike the soviet union where we allegedly came from.

Everything became more simple after I became French. For the first time of my life, I could fill the forms that were handed to me without having to request the special one made for foreigners, when there was one. People stopped asking me where Czech Republic was and what part did we play in the Yugoslavian war. I was quite successful in my studies, got my high school degree, went through the dreaded preparatory schools for the highly competitive engineering schools. I travelled a lot, studied abroad, learned languages and quite frankly, forgot about all the differences inherent to my country’s transition from communism; as it were ancient history.
My parents now had a house in the south of France and an educated friend base who knew that Czech Republic was also in Europe and that it was not Russia. And even when they didn’t know, they at least knew Prague which was becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination.

It was only recently that I came back to the former Eastern Bloc that my family fled. During a year-long trip across Asia, I happened to meet Janyl in the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan. She was fascinated by the French culture and to be specific… she wanted to see a piano in Paris. We eventually became a couple, overcoming pretty much every cultural obstacle.

We have been a couple for a year now and dreamed of seeing Europe together. But just as the communist era was far and gone for us, we heard the only too familiar phrase for long ago: we don’t issue visas for girls due to prostitution concerns from soviet states.

As this kind of words become increasingly common from European officials or representatives, Kyrgyzstan is slowly developing animosity towards the West. A hopeful ally in the beginning, it has hosted the only U.S. military base in Central Asia for many years. Western tourists can visit freely, no need for visas. But as many former soviet countries, sooner or later they realize that they are no more than a facebook friend of the west. As a result, ties with the West shiver and talks emerge about Kyrgyzstan’s entrance into the Eurasian Customs Union, a revised version of the former Soviet Union, which already includes Kazakhstan.

What lies on the other side is just shy of a wall. Despite a very few lucky ones, no one of the common people is given permission to set foot on European soil, if only for a week. Drastic foreign policy is enforced with such violence that Paris has become no less theoretical than Atlantis. The former Soviet states used to inspire fear amongst their European counterparts, now they have switched to contempt. In the streets of Bishkek, word goes that one girl received a visa to Poland about a year ago, Germany only issues 2-week visas to male citizens who already have relatives in Europe and France doesn’t make visas whatsoever. Tourists agencies are advertising more realistic destinations: The United States, Australia or the nearby China.

In light of our personal experience and external information, we ask ourselves: what happened during the last 25 years? Did relations evolve between the former Eastern bloc and the West? On a political level, certainly. International relations are far from cold war levels, no doubt about that. But what about international relations between people, perception of others among the common folk? 

More down to earth, what about Janyl and Filip visiting Paris? They can’t, she can’t enter because old prejudice is still there. From Kyrgyzstani perspective, the iron curtain is still there. It has just changed owners. From the Soviet Union to the European Union. It used to have blood on one side only, those of people trying to get out. Now, the other side is useful to repel people trying to get in.
Did the western world really want to bring freedom forward as Filip has always learned or did they just want to own the wall? From where we stand, the post-communist transition is just like a Coca-Cola ad: images brighter and more stunning as time goes by, yet still advertising the same old recipe.

Because even after 25 years of post-communist transition, the most reliable way from Moscow to Paris is still not Air France; it is still jumping from a small plane between flying bullets with a parachute.
